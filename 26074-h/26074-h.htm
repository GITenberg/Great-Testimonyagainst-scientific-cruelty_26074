v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>If the support of great and good men, famous throughout
Christendom, will avail to justify a cause, then indeed we who
would utterly abolish the torture of animals by vivisection can
never be put out of countenance.</p>
<p>Difficult would it be indeed to bring together the authority
of so many resounding reputations against any other act of man,
since slavery was abolished.</p>
<p>The poets, philosophers, saints and seers of England have
united to anathematise it as an abomination, and as a deed only
possible to a craven.</p>
<p>It seems strange that in the face of such authentic
condemnation the horrid practice has not disappeared off the face
of the civilised earth, until it is observed that it has received
the shameless support of science, which for two generations has
usurped <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>an authority over conduct for which
it possesses no credentials.&nbsp; The modern prostration of
mankind before science is a vile idolatry.&nbsp; In the realm of
ethics science is not constructive but destructive.&nbsp; It
exalts the Tree of Knowledge and depresses the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>How is the character of man elevated or purified by all the
maddening inventions of science?&nbsp; How indeed!&nbsp; Are we
made better men by being whirled about the globe by machinery, by
the increased opportunities for limitless volubility, or by the
ingenious devices for mutual destruction?&nbsp; And how are we
morally advantaged by the knowledge of the infinite depths of
space, the composition of the stars and the motions of the
planets?</p>
<p>The old Persian, when his far-travelled offspring returned
with these wonders to tell, replied: &ldquo;My son, thou sayest
that one star spinneth about another star; let it
spin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ruskin once remarked: &ldquo;Newton explained why an apple
fell, but he never <!-- page vii--><a name="pagevii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vii</span>thought of explaining the exactly
correlative, but infinitely more difficult question, how the
apple got up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead and dreary law of gravitation made it fall, but the
glorious law of life, known only to God, drew it up out of the
earth and hung it in all its inexplicable wonder high in the
air.</p>
<p>And I think herein is a very good parable applicable to
ourselves and our age.</p>
<p>Science has found out that everything in the Universe is
falling towards everything else, or trying to do so, and we are
so absorbed in this deciduous discovery that we have forgotten to
look up and observe the lovely things about us that by
God&rsquo;s mercy have still escaped the withering touch of
scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>But Science has now moved beyond the comparatively innocuous
accumulation of mechanical discoveries, and advancing into the
domain of morals, has emerged in the sinister aspect of the
defender of cruelty.</p>
<p>This may yet prove an usurpation that will lead to its
ultimate deposition and <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>ignominy.&nbsp; A time is coming when mankind will
have no ear for the advocates of what all the great and good and
wise have denounced as wicked.</p>
<p>If Science comes before the world declaring that cruelty is
necessary for its advance, the world will one day tell Science
that it can stop where it is.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile that there can be no doubt in the mind of any
man as to how the greatest leaders of thought and loftiest
teachers of conduct have united in their condemnation of
vivisection, I have thought it timely to bring them together, a
noble array, in this book.</p>

FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p1b.jpg">
<img alt="The seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, K.G.  From an
engraving by W. J. Edwards after Frederick Sandys"
src="images/p1s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The seventh Earl of Shaftesbury consecrated a long life, and
dedicated a great position to the service of the poor, the weak
and the lost.&nbsp; His life and work were one of the chief
glories of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; From early youth to
venerable age his hand was outstretched to assuage the miseries
of the helpless and to deal a blow at cruelty and selfishness
wherever he discerned it.</p>
<p>By his efforts women were brought up out of coal mines where
they dragged trucks on all fours like brute beasts, by his
protests <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>little boys were saved from being
forced to climb up inside chimneys risking their young lives and
limbs that others might profit thereby.</p>
<p>He placed himself at the head of the fight against all cruelty
to children and became the first President of the Society to put
it down, which has now become great and powerful with officers in
every town to guard child life and protect the helpless little
things from all manner of nameless sufferings.</p>
<p>He championed the animal world and raised his voice against
the unspeakable doings of the vivisectors, and the whole
anti-vivisection movement was started and built up under his wise
and benign guidance, as first President of the Anti-Vivisection
Society.</p>
<p>He belonged to the period when those who worked in the field
of philanthropy were almost exclusively concerned in curing, if
they could, the evils they perceived around them; but he himself
was a pioneer of the later school who aim also at preventing <!--
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>those evils.&nbsp; Those who went before him sought to
assist the poor and helpless, but while he endeavoured to do this
with all his heart, he also strove to destroy the causes of
pauperism.&nbsp; He perceived that physical squalor inevitably
produces spiritual squalor, and that if we are to make men think
and live cleanly we must enable them to possess decent and clean
homes.</p>
<p>Others of his family in the past had served the State with
credit in the great public offices that satisfy men&rsquo;s
reputable pride and honourable ambition, but none before him had
served his fellow creatures during a long life with no other
motive than to bind up their wounds and aggravate the mercies of
God.</p>
<p>His appearance when I had the happiness to know him intimately
was noble and memorable, and he won his way less by commanding
abilities than by weight of character.&nbsp; His large benignity
repressed the expression of any small or mean thought in his
presence; and his arrival was sufficient without his saying a
word to elevate <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the tone and manner of any discussion
in which he was expected to participate.&nbsp; He was incapable
of asperity.</p>
<p>In the House of Lords there was conceded to him by universal
courtesy a special seat which he occupied independently of the
change of parties, a tribute of respect to his unique and
distinguished position which as far as I am aware has at any rate
in recent years been paid to no one else.</p>
<p>He was a survival of the times when rank more recognised its
duties and received more homage than in the present day; for when
I was young it was still possible for the public to believe that
peerages were only conferred on men for serious and meritorious
services to the country, and that those who succeeded to them by
inheritance were trained to recognise the large obligations of
their station.</p>
<p>He lived in a great house on the west side of Grosvenor
Square, tempering his august surroundings with a personal
austerity.&nbsp; There he was easily accessible to anyone who
came to him for good <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>counsel and not to waste his own or
his host&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>Every cabman and costermonger in London knew him by sight and
would take off his cap to him if he saw him in the streets, and
the poor in the East End knew his tall figure and distinguished
countenance better than did the men in the club windows in the
West.</p>
<p>The beautiful monument to his memory in Regent Circus records
that he was &ldquo;an example to his order,&rdquo; and yet better
than this stately panegyric is the happy accident, if it be one,
that the poor flower girls of London have pitched their camp upon
the steps, and have successfully defied all the efforts of Mr.
Bumble to remove them.</p>

6</span>CHAPTER II: MISS FRANCES POWER COBBE</h2>
<p>Miss Frances Power Cobbe was the original organiser and
founder in December, 1875, of the National Anti-Vivisection
Society which until 1898 bore the Title of the Victoria Street
Society for the protection of animals from vivisection.</p>
<p>Many years before, in 1863, there lived at Florence a man who
trafficked in torture named Schiff; &ldquo;among the inferior
professors of medical knowledge,&rdquo; says Dr. Johnson,
&ldquo;is a race of wretches, whose lives are only varied by
varieties of cruelty,&rdquo; and such an one was this
miscreant.</p>
<p>Miss Cobbe was then resident at Florence and was the
correspondent of the <i>Daily News</i>, and in that paper she
denounced the tortures inflicted on animals by this dreadful man,
which so affected her generous <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>heart that for
the rest of her life her chief preoccupation became the desire to
put an end to such abominations.</p>
<p>In 1874 Miss Cobbe drew up a memorial to the Council of the
Royal Society for the prevention of cruelty to animals urging
upon them &ldquo;the immediate adoption of such measures as may
approve themselves to their judgment as most suitable to promote
the end in view, namely, the <i>restriction of
vivisection</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with indefatigable zeal she
collected the signatures to it of a very large number of the most
distinguished men in England; among them were such names as those
of Thomas Carlyle, Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning, John Morley,
John Bright, Leslie Stephen, W. Lecky, B. Jowett, John Ruskin,
Dean Stanley, and Canon Liddon.</p>
<p>In view of the fierce advocacy of vivisection to which the
present Lord Knutsford has committed himself it is interesting to
record that his father Sir Henry Holland&rsquo;s name appears
among the signatories of this memorial.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>The Council of the R.S.P.C.A. in 1875 displayed all the
familiar characteristics of the Council of to-day.&nbsp; On
receiving this notable memorial they adopted the device of
promising to appoint a sub-committee to consider the whole
question of vivisection.&nbsp; Unlike the sub-committee appointed
in 1907 &ldquo;to consider the whole question of sport&rdquo;
which never sat, it seems that this sub-committee on vivisection
really did sit once, after which no more was heard of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Colam the Secretary was sent to call on the leading
vivisectors to ask them about their own proceedings; and the
Council appear to have imagined that, having asked the persons
whose conduct was impugned what they thought about that conduct,
their function as representing the Society entrusted with the
protection of animals from cruelty was fulfilled.</p>
<p>Miss Cobbe, like many of us to-day, really wanted cruelty to
animals stopped, and she was not likely to be satisfied with such
a farcical evasion, so she set to work and <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>started the
Victoria Street Society, and to her above all others therefore
belongs the undying fame and glory of first raising aloft the
standard of the imperishable cause for which that Society exists
and strives.</p>
<p>In that memorable year of 1875 the great Society in Jermyn
Street, misrepresented by a collection of somnolent inefficients,
turned their backs on tortured animals and stopped their ears to
their cries of agony; and all the subsequent years are strewn
with opportunities abandoned and duties neglected which one by
one have been undertaken by fresh Societies of earnest souls who
would wait no more while the Council in Jermyn Street slept; and
that the record should be maintained intact we have seen in the
last three years the generous public subscribe an enormous sum of
money for the care and cure of our horses at the war, only to
discover that the Society is ready to acquiesce when those
horses, that are worn out in our service, are sold abroad to the
highest bidders!</p>
<p>Miss Cobbe during her long combat <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>against
vivisection passed through different phases of opinion as to the
wisest parliamentary policy to pursue.&nbsp; At one time she
advocated restriction, at another total abolition, and I will not
here revive the domestic discussions and differences that were
the consequence of the diverse views entertained by equally
reputable and earnest workers in the cause.&nbsp; It is enough to
recognise and acclaim the fine courage and ability that Miss
Cobbe brought to the service of suffering animals, and the
splendid edifice of the National Anti-Vivisection Society that
was built up from the ground by her capable hands.</p>
<p>She suffered one cruel betrayal when she entrusted to another
too ardent controversialist the translation of some German
account of a severe vivisection, and discovered, after the
publication of the description in English, that her friend had
suppressed in the translation the statement in the original that
an&aelig;sthetics had been employed.</p>
<p>The ferocious attacks made upon her on <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>that occasion
she bore with what philosophy so exasperating a situation
permitted.</p>
<p>Miss Cobbe was a remarkable person both in character and
appearance, her habiliments were quaint and practical, cut
altogether shapelessly with immense buttons symbolising the
entire simplicity of her life and habits, her hair was cut off
short, and her whole aspect suggested cheerfulness, robustness,
and magnanimity.&nbsp; She was masterful in temperament, not
always ready to listen with urbanity to opinions she did not
share, or to admit that her conclusions could even conceivably
have their foundations in doubtful premises.&nbsp; But these very
human characteristics in no way diminished the personal affection
she inspired in those among whom she moved.&nbsp; She lived a
fine courageous life, and when she died, by an appropriate and
beautiful coincidence, a dog was the only witness of her last
breath.</p>

12</span>CHAPTER III: CARDINAL MANNING<br />
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY</h2>
<p>Cardinal Manning was among the early supporters of the
Anti-Vivisection movement, and was a Vice-President of the
National Anti-Vivisection Society till his death.</p>
<p>He occasionally attended meetings of the committee at my
request to assist the deliberations with his good counsel, and I
remember one occasion when Lord Shaftesbury came and took the
chair, and both the Cardinal and my father and the Bishop of
Oxford were present to assist in an important decision.</p>
<p>I frequently went to the Archbishop&rsquo;s house at
Westminster to consult him; the sumptuous cathedral and palace
had not <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>then been built, and the house at the
bottom of Carlisle Place had an air of cold austerity; there were
no carpets on the stone staircase, and the large room in which
the Cardinal received his visitors had nothing in it but a bare
table and a few cushionless chairs.&nbsp; He accepted invitations
to dinner from my father, but although he was gracious and
courtly, he ate nothing, and it was understood that no attention
was to be drawn to this abstinence.&nbsp; He cannot have eaten
much anywhere, for he was extremely emaciated.</p>
<p>He did a great service both to the cause of anti-vivisection
and to his Church in 1882.&nbsp; It had been spread abroad, by
whom, and on what authority, I know not, that the Church of Rome
had declined to support those who desired to put down cruel
experiments upon animals, and had declared that animals might
lawfully be treated like stocks and stones; to this shocking
suggestion the Cardinal gave a decisive and authoritative denial
at a meeting at Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s House on the 21st of
June.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>His words were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I know that an impression has been made that those
whom I represent look, if not with approbation, at least with
great indulgence, on the practice of vivisection.&nbsp; I grieve
to say that abroad there are a great many (whom I beg leave to
say I do <i>not</i> represent) who do favour the practice; but
this I do protest, that there is not a religious instinct in
nature, nor a religion of nature, nor is there a word in
revelation, either in the Old Testament or the New Testament, nor
is there to be found in the great theology which I do represent,
no, nor in any Act of the Church of which I am a member; no, nor
in the lives and utterances of any one of those great servants of
that Church who stand as examples, nor is there an authoritative
utterance anywhere to be found in favour of vivisection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later in the same speech he said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not believe this to be the way that the
All-wise and All-good Maker of us all has ordained for the
discovery of the Healing Art which is one of His greatest gifts
to man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two years later at a Meeting at Prince&rsquo;s Hall on the
26th of June, 1884, with Lord Shaftesbury in the Chair, the
Cardinal in a single pregnant sentence dissipated the
vivisectors&rsquo; <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>constant careless confusion of the
totally different moral acts of killing animals and torturing
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is clear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the words
&lsquo;kill and eat,&rsquo; and the dominion which the beneficent
Maker of all things has given to man over the lower creatures,
does not justify the infliction of exquisite torment in the name
of Science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that time Lord Shaftesbury was the greatest representative
of the Church of England and the Cardinal the acknowledged head
of the Church of Rome in this country and as they earnestly
agreed in condemning the practice of vivisection as wicked and
abominable, it becomes impossible for those who support it to
bring to its defence any authorities on conduct at all comparable
with that of these two great and good men.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Cardinal gave the impression of a consciously
eminent ecclesiastic, who was determined to lift his Church into
greatness in England by all lawful means in his power; his
appearance was ascetic, distinguished, and memorable; he was
manifestly a man of direct nobility of life, and <!-- page
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>most
lofty purpose&mdash;a great statesman for his Church, leading an
austere and detached life as an example in every detail for the
faithful in his community&mdash;a prince of the Roman Church
fulfilling his august function conspicuously and faultlessly in
full view of a critical public. <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>His care for the poor and the noble simplicity of his life
found its most eloquent evidence at his death in the discovery
that his entire worldly possessions amounted to sixty-eight
pounds.</p>
<p>He had laid up his treasure where no rust and moth doth
corrupt.</p>

17</span>CHAPTER IV: ROBERT BROWNING<br />
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY<br />
<span class="smcap">died the 12th of december</span>, 1889</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p17b.jpg">
<img alt="Robert Browning.  From a painting by Samuel Laurence in
the collection of John Lane" src="images/p17s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Towards the end of 1874, as I have already remarked, Miss
Cobbe prepared a petition to the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals of which the chief paragraph ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is earnestly urged by your memorialists that
the great and influential Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals may see fit to undertake the task (which
appears strictly to fall within its province) of placing suitable
restrictions on this rapidly increasing evil.&nbsp; The vast
benefit to the cause of humanity which the Society has in the
past half century effected, would, in our humble estimation,
remain altogether one-sided and incomplete, if, while brutal
carters and ignorant costermongers are brought to punishment for
maltreating the animals under their charge, learned <!-- page
18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and
refined gentlemen should be left unquestioned to inflict far more
exquisite pain upon still more sensitive creatures; as if the
mere allegation of a scientific purpose removed them above all
legal or moral responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Cobbe, confident of what Browning&rsquo;s reply would be,
sent him this petition and asked him to return it with his
signature if he approved of it.</p>
<p>His reply, which I believe has never as yet been published,
redounds to his immortal fame as a man of fortitude and
humaneness.</p>
<p>This is what he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">19, <span
class="smcap">Warwick Crescent</span>, W.<br />
<i>December</i> 28<i>th</i>, &rsquo;74.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Miss Cobbe</span>,</p>
<p>I return the petition, unsigned for the one good
reason&mdash;that I have just signed its fellow forwarded to me
by Mr. Leslie Stephen.</p>
<p>You have heard &ldquo;I take an equal interest with yourself
in the effort to suppress vivisection&rdquo;; I dare not so
honour my mere wishes and prayers as to put them for a moment
beside your noble acts; but, this I know, I would rather submit
to the worst of the deaths, so far as pain goes, than have a
single dog or cat tortured on the pretence <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of sparing me
a twinge or two.&nbsp; I return the paper, because I shall be
probably shut up here for the next week or more, and prevented
from seeing my friends: whoever would refuse to sign would
certainly not be of the number.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Ever truly&mdash;and gratefully
yours,<br />
<span class="smcap">Robert Browning</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Five years later in the volume of Dramatic Idyls issued in
1879, Browning published his poem entitled &ldquo;Tray&rdquo;
which extols the noble heroism of the dog and leaves nothing to
be desired in its biting scorn of the vivisectors:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Up he comes with the child, see
tight<br />
In mouth, alive too, clutched from quite<br />
A depth of ten feet&mdash;twelve I bet!<br />
Good dog!&nbsp; What off again?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s yet<br />
Another child to save?&nbsp; All right!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How strange we saw no other fall!<br />
It&rsquo;s instinct in the animal.<br />
Good dog!&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s a long while under:<br />
If he got drowned I should not wonder&mdash;<br />
Strong current, that against the wall!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here he comes, holds in mouth this time<br />
&mdash;What may the thing be?&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s prime!<br
/>
Now did you ever?&nbsp; Reason reigns<br />
In man alone, since all Tray&rsquo;s pains<br />
Have fished&mdash;the child&rsquo;s doll from the
slime!&rsquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;And so, amid the laughter gay,<br />
Trotted my hero off,&mdash;old Tray,&mdash;<br />
Till somebody, prerogatived<br />
With reason, reasoned:&mdash;&lsquo;Why he dived<br />
His brain would show us, I should say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;John go and catch&mdash;or, if needs be<br />
Purchase&mdash;that animal for me!<br />
By vivisection, at expense<br />
Of half an hour and eighteen pence<br />
How brain secretes dog&rsquo;s soul, we&rsquo;ll
see!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here then is enough to show with what earnest conviction this
poet of powerful mind and pure life condemned the practice of
vivisection.&nbsp; He was a man who breasted the world with a
cheerful philosophy which permitted few external matters to
disturb his habitual serenity.&nbsp; But vivisection was one of
them, and I have often heard him speak with fierce detestation of
what he called &ldquo;the coward Science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not think he ever addressed a public, or even private,
meeting in his life, and that may have left the unlettered world
unaware of his deep loathing of the cruelties of the
laboratories; but he was one of the earliest Englishmen of
unquestioned distinction to join the anti-vivisection movement

<p>I hope that my inclusion of my father in these articles on the
first supporters of the anti-vivisection movement will not be
thought unbecoming.&nbsp; I see no reason why I should not
testify in these pages to the unswerving adhesion he brought to
the cause of humaneness both towards men and women as well as
towards animals, and the wise counsel he afforded to the pioneers
of the fight against vivisection.</p>
<p>It is perhaps now long forgotten that he initiated, drafted
and carried through the House of Commons when he sat in that
assembly as member for Exeter a Bill emancipating married women
from the cruel <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>conditions of servitude whereby their
own earnings could legally be taken from them by their
husbands.</p>
<p>This was the first of a series of wide-minded Acts of
Parliament which established the position of women as no longer
the mere chattels of their male relatives.</p>
<p>Cruelty to animals of any kind roused in him a deep and
abiding anger: he never allowed a bearing rein to be inflicted
upon his horses either in London or the country, nor was there
ever a tied-up dog in his stables.</p>
<p>Lord Coleridge assisted in the efforts to get the
Anti-Vivisection Bill of 1876 passed without the wrecking
amendments that were at the last minute added to it; after the
Bill was passed in its mutilated state Miss Cobbe with a not
unnatural impatience wrote to him and others saying that
&ldquo;the supporters of vivisection having refused to accept a
reasonable compromise or to permit any line to be drawn between
morally justifiable painless experiments and those which are
heinously cruel and <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>involve the torture of the most
sensitive animals&rdquo; she intended to endeavour to induce the
Society &ldquo;to condemn the practice altogether as inseparably
bound up with criminal abuses&rdquo;; and henceforth to adopt
&ldquo;the principle of uncompromising hostility to
vivisection,&rdquo; and she asked him to let her know whether he
would give his support to her proposals.&nbsp; His reply was what
might have been expected from one who could not permit his
irritation at the fate of the Bill to influence his parliamentary
attitude.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am afraid [he wrote] my answer must be in a
sense which you will think unfavourable.&nbsp; I could not commit
myself out of Parliament to any view which I am not prepared to
defend <i>in</i> it.&nbsp; And the unreasonableness and what I
think wrongdoing of the Medical Men would not justify me as a
legislator in voting for what <i>I</i> think wrong merely in
opposition to them or because I could not bring them to terms
which I think just and right.</p>
<p>I do not say that this is at all necessarily the rule for a
person out of Parliament, because so long as you do not agitate
for what you think <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span><i>wrong</i> it is perfectly fair to
agitate for more than you expect to get as a means of getting
something of what you think right.&nbsp; So that I find no fault
whatever with any one who takes the view you take; but my
position is somewhat a peculiar one and I must be cautious to an
extent that some people may think coldness and weakness.&nbsp; I
am not afraid of your judgment however.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Six years later, in 1882, he wrote an article in the
<i>Fortnightly Review</i> in which he definitely though
reluctantly gave his adhesion to total abolition as the goal to
be aimed at, but of course he never at any time associated
himself with the condemnation of all other measures for the
mitigation of the cruelties of the laboratory or of the world at
large that has since been pronounced by the more extreme
protagonists on the anti-vivisection side of the controversy.</p>
<p>This article dealt in a pungent severity with attacks made
upon him in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> by Sir James Paget,
Professor Owen and Dr. Wilks.&nbsp; As far as I know none of them
rejoined.&nbsp; They had had enough!</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>But the last passage of the article is of a quality that
I think my readers will regard as fully justifying my reproducing
it here,&mdash;I hope it will receive their endorsement&mdash;the
hand that wrote it has long been still, but thirty-four years
have not made one word of it less true or less beautiful.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is one authority, conclusive, no doubt, only
to those who admit it, conclusive only to those who believe that
they can read it, to which in conclusion I dare appeal.&nbsp;
When a bishop in the Southern States had been defending slavery,
he was asked what he thought our Lord would have said, what looks
He who turned and looked upon St. Peter would have cast upon a
slave-mart in New Orleans, where husband was torn from wife,
child from parent, and beautiful girls, with scarce a tinge of
colour in them, were sold into prostitution.&nbsp; The answer of
the bishop is not known, but I will venture on a kindred
question.&nbsp; What would our Lord have said, what looks would
He have bent, upon a chamber filled with &ldquo;the unoffending
creatures which He loves,&rdquo; dying under torture deliberately
and intentionally inflicted? or kept alive to endure further
torment, in pursuit of knowledge?&nbsp; Men must answer this
question according to their consciences; and for any man <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>to make himself in such a matter a rule for any other
would be, I know, unspeakable presumption.&nbsp; But to anyone
who recognises the authority of our Lord, and who persuades
himself that he sees which way that authority inclines, the mind
of Christ must be the guide of life.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shouldest thou
not have had compassion upon these, even as I had pity on
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; So He seems to me to say, and I shall act
accordingly.</p>

28</span>CHAPTER VI: JOHN RUSKIN</h2>
<p>No one who has ever read a line of Ruskin could doubt on which
side his mind and heart would be ranged in the controversy over
vivisection.</p>
<p>Here was a lord of language who was also one of the great
moral teachers of the world.&nbsp; To him the torture of a
helpless animal for a scientific purpose was a defiance of
religion and an insult to God.&nbsp; Such pursuits he declared
&ldquo;were all carried on in defiance of what had hitherto been
held to be compassion and pity, and of the great link which bound
together the whole of creation from its Maker to the lowest
creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p28b.jpg">
<img alt="John Ruskin.  From a drawing by Samuel Laurence in the
collection of John Lane" src="images/p28s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>He occupied the illustrious post of Slade Professor of art at
Oxford when convocation voted to endow vivisection in the
University and install Dr. Burdon Sanderson, the <!-- page
29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>smotherer of dogs, in a laboratory set up for him.</p>
<p>In vain did Ruskin protest against this horrible educational
cancer being grafted on to the happiness, peace, and light of
gracious Oxford.&nbsp; Convocation preferred the blight of the
coward Science to the cultivation of all that was beautiful,
distinguished, humane, and brave; and they reaped as they had
sown, they kept the dog smotherer and lost the radiant spirit and
uplifting eloquence of the inspired seer.&nbsp; Ruskin resigned
and Oxford heard that voice of supreme nobility no more.</p>
<p>The Vice-Chancellor for very shame could not bring himself to
read Ruskin&rsquo;s letter of resignation to convocation.&nbsp;
The editor of the <i>University Gazette</i> also had the
effrontery to leave a letter from Ruskin, giving the reasons for
his resignation, unpublished; and the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>
crowned the edifice of poltroonery by announcing that he had
resigned owing to his &ldquo;advancing years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Evil communications corrupt good manners, and
association with vivisection led these dignitaries and editors to
flout and insult a man whose shoe strings they were not worthy to
tie.&nbsp; Time is merciful and their very names are
forgotten.</p>
<p>Ruskin had, a little time before these events, asked the
University for a grant to build a well-lighted room for the
undergraduates apart from the obscure and inconvenient Ruskin
school; his request was instantly refused on the plea that the
University was in debt, yet in the very next year this debt
encumbered seat of learning and courtesy voted &pound;10,000 for
the erection of a laboratory for the vivisector and &pound;2,000
more towards fitting it up and maintaining it,&mdash;for troughs
and gags and cages and the rest of the horrible
paraphernalia.</p>
<p>This must I should imagine be the most squalid page in the
history of modern Oxford.</p>
<p>More than thirty years have passed since that University thus
publicly preferred a <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>dog smootherer to one of the noblest
of teachers and saintliest of men.</p>
<p>Both are now long departed.&nbsp; The one can no more block up
the wind-pipes of living dogs and watch their dying convulsions,
and the other can no longer lead the minds of youths and maidens
to seek and find beauty in the visible world about them and
recognise in it the hand of God&mdash;but the world has known
which of these men led the youth of Oxford to look up and which
to look down, and to-day a merciful oblivion covers the names and
doings of this triumphant vivisector and his valiant supporters,
while to the farthest inch of the English-speaking realms the
writings of Ruskin are treasured in a million homes and his name
acclaimed with grateful reverence.</p>
<p><i>NOTE</i>.&mdash;This chapter on Ruskin having appeared as
an article in <i>The Animals&rsquo; Defender and Zoophilist</i>
in March, 1917, and a copy of it having been sent to the
Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, the following
correspondence ensued:&mdash;</p>

sending me the copy of <i>The Zoophilist</i>.&nbsp; May I point
out that it is not customary for the Vice-Chancellor to read to

your letter of the 3rd of March informing me that it is not
customary for the Vice-Chancellor to read to Convocation the
letters of professors who resign or to print such letters in the

Vice-Chancellor is precluded by any rule of Convocation from
reading such a letter, or that the editor if there be one of the
University Gazette is unable by any rule of his office to admit
such a letter to his columns&mdash;and I therefore feel that I
was quite entitled to make the comments I did in <i>The
Animals&rsquo; Defender and Zoophilist</i>.&nbsp; When such a man
as Ruskin desired the reasons for his resignation to be made <!--

that enabled the University to conceal those reasons and even
permit misapprehensions of those reasons to be given a wide
publicity, would have been better than its observance.&nbsp; And
a University Gazette that refuses to publish the letter of a
world-famous professor of that University, must arrogate to
itself a title to which it can justly make no claim.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At this distance of time it is probable that the present Dean
of Christ Church may not fully realise the sort of person
Professor Sanderson, whom the University preferred to Ruskin,
was: I therefore think he may like to see a letter I wrote at the
time to the papers which has fortunately been preserved:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I hope you
will find room for an answer to the remarkable letter of
Professor Acland in your issue of the 9th, and to
&ldquo;F.R.S.&rsquo;s&rdquo; attack on Miss Cobbe in that of the
10th of March.</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>Professor Acland says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to say to English parents that everyone at home
and abroad, who knows anything of biological science in England,
will think them fortunate if their children being students of
medicine, fall under the elevating influence of Professor
Sanderson&rsquo;s scientific and personal character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;F.R.S.&rdquo; says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a very constant attendant at Dr.
Sanderson&rsquo;s private laboratory during the last ten years of
his professorship at University College, and during the whole of
that time I never witnessed a single operation involving
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, are we not justified in estimating Professor
Sanderson&rsquo;s nobility of disposition by his books?</p>
<p>He was joint author and editor of the &ldquo;Handbook for the
Physiological Laboratory,&rdquo; the publication in which of the
tortures of animals roused a feeling in the country that led to
the appointment of the Royal Commission to inquire into these
practices.&nbsp; And is he not now one of the editors of the
<i>Journal of Physiology</i>, which continually details to the
world experiments involving terrible torments?</p>
<p><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>In his &ldquo;Handbook of Physiology&rdquo; we find such
descriptions as the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Page 319.&nbsp; &ldquo;(109).&mdash;<i>Asphyxia by complete
Occlusion of the Trachea</i>.&mdash;For this purpose a cannula
must be fixed air-tight in the trachea, the mouth of which is of
such form that it can be plugged with a cork. . . . The phenomena
as they present themselves in the dog. . . .&nbsp; <i>First
minute</i>.&nbsp; Excessive respiratory movements in which at
first the expansive efforts of the thoracic muscles, afterwards
the expulsive efforts of the abdominal wall, are most
violent.&nbsp; Towards the close of the first minute the animal
becomes convulsed.&nbsp; <i>Second minute</i>.&nbsp; Early in the
second minute the convulsions cease, often suddenly;
simultaneously with the cessation the expiratory efforts become
indistinguishable.&nbsp; The iris is now dilated to a rim; the
eye does not close when the cornea is touched, nor does the pupil
react to light; all reflex reaction to stimuli has ceased.&nbsp;
All the muscles except those of inspiration are flaccid, and the
animal lies in a state of tranquility which contrasts in the most
striking way with the storm which preceded it . . . <i>Third and
fourth minute</i>.&nbsp; As death approaches the thoracic and
abdominal movements which are entirely respiratory become slow
and slower as well as shallower. . . . In the spasms which
accompany the final gasps of an asphyxiated <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>animal the
head is thrown back, the trunk straightening or arched backwards,
and the limbs are extended while the mouth gapes and the nostrils
dilate.&nbsp; They are called by physiologists stretching
convulsions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Page 320.&nbsp; &ldquo;(110).&mdash;<i>Asphyxia by Slow
Suffocation</i>.&mdash;When an animal is allowed to breathe the
same quantity of air repeatedly and continuously out of a bag,
the process being of much longer duration, the phenomena can be
studied with greater facility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, is it &ldquo;ill-natured or ill-mannered&rdquo; to
think that parents will <i>not</i> be fortunate if &ldquo;their
children fall under the elevating influence of Dr.
Sanderson&rsquo;s scientific and personal character&rdquo;?</p>
<p>We want to know how medicine is advanced by the agonies of
these suffocated animals?</p>
<p>It may be true that Professor Sanderson at present holds no
certificate, nor does Dr. Michael Foster, who occupies a similar
position at Cambridge, but Dr. Michael Foster has
&ldquo;assistants&rdquo; who hold from time to time certificates,
and quite lately, &ldquo;under his guidance,&rdquo; a lady, Miss
Emily Nunn, has been poisoning frogs till their skin comes
off.&nbsp; There is nothing to prevent Professor Sanderson from
employing assistants.&nbsp; The mind may be the mind of Professor
Sanderson, but the <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>knife may be the knife of such a man
as Dr. Klein, who was his former assistant at the Brown
Institution, and who has publicly declared that &ldquo;he has no
regard at all for the sufferings of the animals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the publication of this letter the Dean of Christ Church of
that day, Dean Liddell, wrote to me a long rambling letter which
I could not then, and cannot now, publish because it concludes
with these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I have written this not for publication.&nbsp; I
will not engage in newspaper controversy.&nbsp; I write to you,
out of respect for the name you bear,&mdash;not in anger but in
sorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>To my letter in the Press you have no word to
offer.&nbsp; In it I quote verbatim Professor Sanderson&rsquo;s
own description of one of the many wanton torments that he has
inflicted upon the good creatures of God.&nbsp; I ask how
medicine is advanced by <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the agonies of the dogs he has slowly
suffocated, and I get no answer (though I have sent the letter to
him and some twenty other vivisectors) but this expression from
you of sorrow that the name I bear should be ranged on the side
of this man&rsquo;s opponents.</p>
<p>Sir, I am a young man, unskilled in polemics and unpractised
in the art of advocacy, no match for one of mature age, ripe
experience, and stored learning; but if an enthusiasm for mercy,
a belief that human life itself is not fitly bought by the
torturing of the helpless, an amazement that any Christian, nay
that any man should call one of these tormentors
&ldquo;friend,&rdquo; be sentiments the holding of which by one
of my name fills you with sorrow if not with anger, it without
doubt is plain that our name is but a name to you, and that your
respect for it should have been withdrawn when it first came into
prominence.</p>
<p>I do not believe you know what things these men have done; it
is a terrible task for any man to read their literature; if you
had done so I do indeed believe that not your sorrow only but
your anger would be deeply roused, but&mdash;not against me.</p>

40</span>CHAPTER VII: DR. JOHNSON</h2>
<p>Of all the Masters of letters that have adorned and elevated
the speech of our race Dr. Johnson is in many ways the most
lovable.&nbsp; The son of a poor bookseller in Lichfield <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> with an uncouth figure and an
undistinguished countenance, he rose by the massive force of his
character and the tireless persistence of his industry to an
unchallenged supremacy in the literary world of his age,
displaying in his whole life the truth of his own dictum that
&ldquo;few things are impossible to diligence and
skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Disdaining the common habit of the times he
would owe nothing to the patronage of the great.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
not a patron,&rdquo; he wrote to Lord Chesterfield, &ldquo;one
who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the
water, and when he has reached ground encumbers him with
help?&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>He was not very patient with the stupid, or merciful to
the absurd, and vanity never came into his presence without
receiving swift and mortal blows; but the chastisement of his
caustic tongue never fell upon modest worth, and there never
lived a man who was a more faithful and affectionate friend.</p>
<p>The style of his writing is always balanced and sonorous, and
everywhere and always is he &ldquo;the friend of the wise and
teacher of the good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man was more ready to give forcible expression to his
amusing prejudices, as when he exclaimed that &ldquo;the noblest
prospect which a Scotchman ever sees is the high road that leads
him to England,&rdquo; but to be able to assert of any act of man
that Dr. Johnson in solemn seriousness condemned it, is for ever
to arraign that act in the court of human morals; and so the
judicious must concede that when his authority can be cited in
fierce and glowing denunciation of vivisectors they are left in a
demersed condition.</p>
<p><!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>I took occasion when giving evidence before the last
Royal Commission on Vivisection to rehearse Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
philippic which I now reproduce below, and the dejected and
deflated aspect of the vivisectors on the commission when I had
finished it caused that moment to be one of those I shall always
recall with exhilaration!&nbsp; Not a word had one of them to say
while I waited for any comment they might adventure, and after a
diverting and eloquent silence Lord Selby from the chair
remarked, &ldquo;That leaves no doubt about Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s
view in his day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It most certainly does not!</p>
<blockquote><p>The <i>Idlers</i> that sport only with inanimate
nature may claim some indulgence; if they are useless, they are
still innocent; but there are others, whom I know not how to
mention without more emotion than my love of quiet willingly
admits.&nbsp; Among the inferior professors of medical knowledge
is a race of wretches whose lives are only varied by varieties of
cruelty; whose favourite amusement is to nail dogs to tables and
open them alive; to try how long life may be continued in various
degrees of mutilation, or with the excision or laceration of the
vital parts; to examine <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>whether burning irons are felt more
acutely by the bone or tendon; and whether the more lasting
agonies are produced by poison forced into the mouth, or injected
into the veins, it is not without reluctance that I offend the
sensibility of the tender mind with images like these.&nbsp; If
such cruelties were not practised it were to be desired that they
should not be conceived; but, since they are published every day
with ostentation, let me be allowed once to mention them, since I
mention them with abhorrence.&nbsp; <i>Mead</i> has invidiously
remarked of <i>Woodward</i> that he gathered shells and stones,
and would pass for a philosopher.&nbsp; With pretentions much
less reasonable the anatomical novice tears out the living bowels
of an animal and styles himself physician, prepares himself by
familiar cruelty for that profession which he is to exercise upon
the tender and the helpless, upon feeble bodies and broken minds,
and by which he has opportunities to extend his arts and torture,
and continue those experiments upon infancy and age, which he has
hitherto tried upon cats and dogs.&nbsp; What is alleged in
defence of these hateful practices everyone knows, but the truth
is that by knives, fire, and poisons, knowledge is not always
sought, and is very seldom attained.&nbsp; I know not that by
living dissections any discovery has been made by which a single
malady is more easily cured.&nbsp; And if the knowledge of
physiology has <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>been somewhat increased, he surely
buys knowledge dear who learns the use of the lacteals at the
expense of his own humanity.&nbsp; It is time that a universal
resentment should arise against those horrid operations, which
tend to harden the heart and make the physician more dreadful
than the gout or the stone.</p>

45</span>CHAPTER VIII: THOMAS CARLYLE<br />
VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY</h2>
<p>The world of letters and of ethics has hardly yet settled
whether much of the teaching of the Sage of Chelsea should be the
subject of praise or blame.</p>
<p>In the advocacy of fine principles of conduct set forth for us
in language of surpassing eloquence and earnest conviction in
many a page of &ldquo;Sartor Resartus,&rdquo; and scattered
through innumerable pamphlets, Carlyle commands the fervent
adhesion of the honest, the brave, and the good; while in other
parts of his writings his infatuated admiration of force, however
clothed with brutality, and of strength, however marred with
mendacity, are calculated <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>as deeply to
alienate the urbane man of the world as the austere
Christian.</p>
<p>And this confusion in the estimate of Carlyle and of his
teaching suffers an aggravation from the manifest malice of the
biography of him perpetrated by his friend James Anthony
Froude.&nbsp; A man who is entrusted with the task of writing the
life of a great man who was also his friend need not adopt the
language of continuous panegyric, but to throw a brilliant
illumination upon the man&rsquo;s smaller domestic rugosities
which even the weakest charity would conceal and the feeblest
generosity would forget is a singularly spiteful betrayal.</p>
<p>When something was said to Carlyle about the likelihood of the
Dean of Westminster recognising his fame as justifying his
interment in the Abbey, the rugged old man exclaimed,
&ldquo;Deliver me from that body-snatcher.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would
have been more to the purpose if he had been delivered from his
intimate friend as his biographer!</p>
<p>That Carlyle detested vivisection, however, <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>must ever
remain a great tribute both to him and to our cause.&nbsp; Many
circumstances of the man and his teaching might have led the
world to anticipate that he would very likely be found
indifferent on the subject.&nbsp; His earnest adhesion to our
principles leaves those who politely call us old women of both
sexes in a foolish case, for nothing could be more divertingly
absurd than so to classify Carlyle.</p>
<p>I think Froude forgot to mention Carlyle&rsquo;s stern
condemnation of vivisection in his biography, which is more
remarkable inasmuch as Froude himself was a firm and outspoken
supporter of our cause.</p>
<p>Whether we can faithfully take to heart and follow all the
teaching of this &ldquo;old Man eloquent&rdquo; will long remain
a subject of debate, but no one can rise from his works without
recognising a moral grandeur in him that far out-tops the very
human flaws that may even serve to make him more penetrative to
our own imperfect hearts.</p>
<p>There seems to be a law that compels all <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the truly
great men of letters, from Shakespeare and Johnson down to our
own day, to abhor the torture of animals for our supposed
benefit, and to that law Thomas Carlyle starkly adhered.</p>

VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY</h2>

</a></p>
<p>Tennyson, as was inevitable with a man of such nobility of
mind and life, regarded the torture of animals for the sake of
knowledge with &ldquo;the hate of hate, the scorn of
scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If authority be cited in great moral questions here is one
that must compel reverence from all but the poor trifler with his
&ldquo;hollow smile and frozen sneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked modern Science in the eye, perceived whither its
aggrandisement of knowledge to a place supreme in human estimate,
above conduct, must inevitably lead mankind, and proclaimed, in
accents which can never die, that it is impossible for man to
acquiesce in a godless world.</p>
<p>He taught us that men&rsquo;s hearts can never <!-- page
50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>be
satisfied with a world explained and comprised by the cold
&ldquo;changeless law&rdquo; of foreordained evolution and
inevitable destiny.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowledge comes,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but wisdom lingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the first, then, Tennyson lent the weight of his splendid
name to the cause of mercy, and I find his signature to the
original great petition for the restriction of vivisection
between those of Leslie Stephen and Robert Browning on the same
sheet of paper&mdash;a sheet of paper now one of the treasured
possessions of the National Anti-Vivisection Society.</p>
<p>All the world knows the allusions in his works to those who
&ldquo;carve the living hound,&rdquo; and to curare, which he
called &ldquo;the hellish oorali.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus this
greatest poet of the Victorian age gave the weight of his
commanding authority for all time to a fierce condemnation of
vivisection as the most awful and monstrous of the offsprings of
modern Science.</p>
<p>Tennyson was religious in the widest and most inspiring
sense.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Almost the finest summing up of religion,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;is &lsquo;to do justice, to love mercy, and to
walk humbly with God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To love mercy!&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the true sign of
magnanimity in man.&nbsp; All holy men, all brave men, all great
and knightly men have loved mercy.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is an
attribute to God Himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time passes, and succeeding races of mankind, like the leaves
of autumn, are blown away and perish, but countless men of heroic
mould, reaching back into the dim mists of legend and down
through innumerable years while the great world spins &ldquo;for
ever down the ringing grooves of change,&rdquo; have one and all
been gloriously crowned with the same shining diadem of
mercy.</p>

52</span>CHAPTER X: CARDINAL NEWMAN</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p52b.jpg">
<img alt="Cardinal Newman.  From the portrait by Jane Fortescue,
Lady Coleridge" src="images/p52s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>It is difficult perhaps for students of the younger generation
to realise the immense influence exercised among his
contemporaries by Cardinal Newman, nor will a study of his
writings adequately explain it to them.</p>
<p>He has hardly survived as a standard author, though he wrote a
pure and lucid prose.&nbsp; Those who leave the bulk of their
literary work behind them in the form of sermons are inviting the
world to neglect it.</p>
<p>Moreover, though he was a past master of controversy, the
arena in which he fought with such doughty prowess amid the
excited plaudits and dehortations of vast assemblies is now left
solitary in echoing emptiness, and the crowds of to-day have
passed away to abet the combatants, on one <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>side or the
other, in very different fields of tourney.</p>
<p>Here and there his writing ascends to a fine note of
eloquence, as in his great exclamatory passage on music that
begins thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are seven notes in the scale; make them
fourteen: yet what a slender outfit for so vast an
enterprise!&nbsp; What science brings so much out of so
little?&nbsp; Out of what poor elements does some great master in
it create his new world!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But all his writings, religious and controversial, will not
explain the immense and dominating effect Newman produced upon
his contemporaries.&nbsp; That effect was due to the irresistible
magic of his personality.&nbsp; He was manifestly one of the
Saints of God, and his presence brought with it into any company
a sense of mighty power gloved in stainless humility.&nbsp;
Though habitually bearing an aspect of wistful gentleness, his
entry into a room crowded with distinguished people made them all
seem to be something less than they were before his arrival.</p>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>A man of such a character commands by his visible
presence, and those who have not felt the spell of it do not
comprehend the cause of his authoritative influence among those
who have.</p>
<p>The teaching of Newman on the great question of man&rsquo;s
relation to the sentient creatures placed in his power in the
world, must come to us with all the weight that is implicit in
the utterance of one of such unquestioned sanctity.</p>
<p>It would be difficult in all his voluminous works to discover
anything more touching and moving than his reference to the
sufferings of animals, who as he says &ldquo;have done no
harm,&rdquo; which is embedded in the seventh volume of his
Parochial and Plain Sermons:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>First, as to these sufferings, you will observe
that our Lord is called a Lamb in the text; that is, He was as
defenceless and as innocent as a lamb is.&nbsp; Since then
Scripture compares Him to this inoffensive and unprotected
animal, we may, without presumption or irreverence, take the
image as a means of conveying to our minds those feelings which
our Lord&rsquo;s sufferings should excite in <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>us.&nbsp; I
mean, consider how very horrible it is to read the accounts which
sometimes meet us of cruelties exercised on brute animals.&nbsp;
Does it not sometimes make us shudder to hear tell of them, or to
read them in some chance publication which we take up?&nbsp; At
one time it is the wanton deed of barbarous and angry owners who
ill-treat their cattle, or beasts of burden; and at another it is
the cold-blooded and calculating act of men of science, who make
experiments on brute animals, perhaps merely from a sort of
curiosity.</p>
<p>I do not like to go into particulars, for many reasons, but
one of those instances which we read of as happening in this day,
and which seems more shocking than the rest, is when the poor
dumb victim is fastened against a wall, pierced, gashed, and so
left to linger out its life.&nbsp; Now, do you not see that I
have a reason for saying this, and am not using these distressing
words for nothing?&nbsp; For what was this but the very cruelty
inflicted upon our Lord?&nbsp; He was gashed with the scourge,
pierced through hands and feet, and so fastened to the Cross, and
there left, and that as a spectacle.&nbsp; Now, what is it moves
our very hearts and sickens us so much as cruelty shown to poor
brutes?&nbsp; I suppose this first, that they have done no harm;
next, that they have no power whatever of resistance; it is the
cowardice and tyranny of which they are the victims which make
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>their sufferings so especially touching.&nbsp; For
instance, if they were dangerous animals, take the case of wild
beasts at large, able not only to defend themselves, but even to
attack us; much as we might dislike to hear of their wounds and
agony, yet our feelings would be of a very different kind, but
there is something so very dreadful, so satanic in tormenting
those who never have harmed us, and who cannot defend themselves,
who are utterly in our power, who have weapons neither of offence
nor defence, that none but very hardened persons can endure the
thought of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us listen with all our hearts to this beautiful
appeal.&nbsp; Let us reverence the saintly man who made it, and
who still speaks to us out of the past.&nbsp; Let us remember
that Knowledge and the search for it may often be cruel, but that
Wisdom and those who follow it are always merciful.</p>
<h2><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>CHAPTER XI: THREE GREAT CHURCHMEN</h2>
<p>I have already recorded in these pages the strenuous
opposition to vivisection displayed by the two greatest
representatives of the Church of Rome that arose in England in
the last century; and to all who adhere to that Church the
authority of the two illustrious Cardinals Newman and Manning
must be decisive.</p>
<p>The most famous dignitaries of the English Church in the great
Victorian age were also as firm in their condemnation of
vivisection as were the great Cardinals.</p>
<p>When I was a young man Dean Stanley was the Dean of
Westminster, Dean Vaughan was the Master of the Temple, and
Liddon Canon of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; These were all men of
world-wide distinction.&nbsp; They were men who adorned and made
splendid the offices and dignities they <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>occupied,
their names were familiar in every corner of the land, they lent
a lustre to the Church of England, and each of them utterly
condemned vivisection.</p>
<p>In these present times only a few people in the metropolis,
and hardly anybody out of it, can tell without consulting some
book of reference who may be the estimable persons who to-day
fill the Deanery of Westminster and the Mastership of the Temple,
nor has Canon Liddon any successor that the world acclaims, and I
can vouch for it that none of them has ever extended to us a
helping hand or publicly condemned the torture of animals for
scientific purposes.</p>
<p>It is always the loftiest names in literature and the most
illustrious authorities on ethics that are found ranged against
the infliction of suffering upon helpless animals for the
enlargement of human knowledge.</p>
<p>Those who support such inflictions are never in the first rank
of literature, art, or moral teaching.&nbsp; Dean Stanley left
behind him a reputation incomparably greater than any occupier of
his Deanery that has succeeded <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>him.&nbsp;
The same must be conceded to Dean Vaughan at the Temple; and the
eloquence of Canon Liddon compelled the absorbed attention of
such congregations as are not now collected by the Canons that
have followed him.&nbsp; As far as I am aware, none of the
successors of these great men have ever helped our cause at
all.</p>
<p>No doubt whenever there shall arise in the ministry of the
Church of England men of the commanding power, distinguished
character, and potent speech that these great men of the last
generation displayed we shall find them also espousing the cause
of the helpless vivisected animals; in the meanwhile the
occupiers of the most dignified positions in the Established
Church seem to have drifted into the somewhat ignoble attitude of
avoiding the disagreeable subject of vivisection
altogether.&nbsp; When we invite them to help us we receive
either no reply at all, or a reply that is carefully evasive, or
we are damned with faint praise while assured that the writer is
too busy to give the subject the attention it needs before <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>any public utterance is possible upon it.&nbsp; All of
which methods of dealing with the matter display much wisdom of
the world and a very human desire to avoid controversy and other
uncomfortable mental and epistolary disturbance, but none of the
spirit that led Archbishop Temple when he was Bishop of Exeter to
stand unflinching on a temperance platform while the publicans
pelted him with flour.</p>
<h2><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>CHAPTER XII: QUEEN VICTORIA</h2>
<p>Queen Victoria has given her name to a period which has no
parallel in magnificence since the days of the great
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>The galaxy of great poets, teachers, and philosophers that
flourished in the Victorian age cannot be matched in any similar
series of years in all the history of the modern world.</p>
<p>With her departure exhaustion seems to have come upon the
world of letters for a time, and to the classic glories of the
nineteenth century there has succeeded an usurpation of
journalists without the splendour of genius or even the
distinction of scholarship.</p>
<p>And although we may perhaps recognise in Lord
Beaconsfield&rsquo;s inclusive use of the <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>phrase to her
of &ldquo;we authors, Madam&rdquo; something of the flattery of
the courtier, yet assuredly in all her public addresses to her
people there is displayed a fine and biblical simplicity, and a
directness of appeal indicative of a noble mind and a great
heart.</p>
<p>The most penetrating criticism will fail to discover a fault
either of taste or diction or intent in any of these
utterances.&nbsp; They combine the dignity appropriate to the
words of the greatest Sovereign of the World, with the intimate
friendliness that proceeds from the wellsprings of a sweet
woman&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>Worthily then did she reign over the most splendid times of
our history.</p>
<p>That she should from the day she ascended the throne to the
day of her death forward and abet all the enlargements of the
spirit of mercy and pity towards the suffering, whether among man
or animals, was inevitable in a nature so benevolent.&nbsp; And
it may very well be that in far distant times the rise of
humaneness to man and beast <!-- page 63--><a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>will be
regarded as one of the noblest characteristics of her reign.</p>
<p>Her position above controversies precluded her from
participating in them, and made it difficult if not impossible
for her publicly to espouse the cause of the miserable creatures
subjected to nameless sufferings in the laboratories of the
scientific.&nbsp; But her sympathy with those who strove and
still strive to end those sufferings could not always be
concealed, and on a memorable occasion she expressed her
concurrence in the efforts of those who desired to see the laws
sanctioning such suffering totally abolished and repealed.</p>
<p>Very fitting therefore it is that among those who earnestly
condemned vivisection we should include the august name and fame
of Queen Victoria.</p>

64</span>CHAPTER XIII: COMPASSED ABOUT WITH SO GREAT A CLOUD OF
WITNESSES</h2>
<p>Among the eminent men and women of England whose names are not
to be regarded as world famous in the sense that applies to those
dealt with in the foregoing chapters, but who nevertheless in
their place and time were recognised by their contemporaries and
are still recognised by those now living as persons of authority
and ability, there can be cited a distinguished array who
consistently condemned vivisection as permitted and as practised
in this country as immoral.&nbsp; Among religious leaders may be
enumerated the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Archbishop McEvilly, of Tuam; Archbishop Crozier, Primate of
Ireland; Archbishop Bagshawe; Bishop Westcott, of Durham; Bishop
Moule, of Durham; <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Bishop Harold Browne, of Winchester;
Bishop Lord Arthur Hervey, of Bath and Wells; Bishop Ryle, of
Liverpool; Bishop Walsham How, of Wakefield; Bishop Ridding, of
Southwell; Bishop Moorhouse, of Manchester; Bishop Mackarness, of
Oxford; Bishop Chinnery-Haldane, of Argyll and the Isles; Bishop
Barry, Primate of Australia; Dean Kichten.&nbsp; Archdeacon
Wilberforce; Father Ignatius; General Booth, the founder of the
Salvation Army; Spurgeon; Hugh Price Hughes; Newman Hall; James
Martineau; Stopford Brooke.</p>
<p>Among prominent teachers and scholars and philosophers and
writers and artists and lawyers I find the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Alfred Russel Wallace, Freeman, Froude, Leslie Stephen,
Richard Holt Hutton, Sir Henry Taylor, Sir Lewis Morris, George
Macdonald, Blackmore, Wilkie Collins, &ldquo;Lewis
Carroll,&rdquo; Robert Buchanan, Justin McCarthy, Sir Arthur
Arnold, Mrs. Somerville, Julia Wedgwood, Sir Edward Burne-Jones,
Walter Crane, Sir Henry Irving, <!-- page 66--><a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>Lord Brampton
(Mr. Justice Hawkins), and Lord Chief Baron Kelly.</p>
<p>I have made no research for great names in foreign countries,
but some of the most illustrious stand prominently before the
world representing the three greatest continental races:</p>
<p>Victor Hugo, Wagner, Tolstoy, Voltaire, Schopenhauer,
Rousseau.</p>
<p>Here then I have brought together a very glorious company
justifying the title I have affixed to this book.</p>
<h2><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>NOTE</h2>
<p>From this great cloud of witnesses I have omitted all those
leaders of thought and morals, &ldquo;friends of the wise and
teachers of the good&rdquo; supporters of this great cause who
are living.&nbsp; I followed a like reserve in my
&ldquo;Memories,&rdquo; making in them none but passing allusions
to famous persons still alive.&nbsp; I do not share the modern
journalistic habit of uninvited public intrusion upon living
people who may very well be unwilling at the moment to be dragged
into controversy or exposed to insult; and every one knows that
the vivisectors and their friends have no manners, and flout all
the Hague conventions of debate.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
